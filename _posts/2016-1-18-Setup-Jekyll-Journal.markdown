It take me six hours to re-learn and setup git/github, and another six hours to figure out the basic of github pages & [Jekyll][jekyll]. 

As a result of this mini-struggle, now my [MATLAB][matpub] published htmls are automatically published to Jekyll Journal hosted on github, as simple as drag and drop.
