%% Combined Factors  -  Summary

%% 
% I picked up the factor portfolio idea about one years ago from a series of AQR papers.
% The idea is intuitive and simple, and within a couple of months I manage to replicate the results.  
% There are quite a few practical considerations when I decide to implement it for real. Usually when I need to 
% deal with multiple designe considerations, the most important thing is to decide the 'maganitude' or 'significance' of 
% each choice towards final results. 20/80 rules applies here, i.e. the top few factor determines the majority of results variations. 

%%
% Here is a list of things I found surprising after I went through this
% exercise. 

%% Surprises
% # [Diversification] in factors is important. Individual factor's signal is pretty weak, to the order of 0.3~0.5 signal to noise ratio, but by combining 
% all those weak signals, I can achieve a strong signal to the magnitude of
% above 1.0 signal-to-noise ratio. 
% # [Leverage] Between signal and risk, the first consideration should be risk. As
% Berkshire's portfolio demonstrated, there is a lot to be gain from take a
% moderate leverage. The relationship between risk and return is one of
% most simple, yet one of the most under-appreciated result in investment
% community. 
% # [Transaction cost] is surprisingly less than funding cost, and rolling
% yield in futures contracts is very important. 
% # optimization is important. Even though a no brainer equal weighted
% factor loading performed reasonably well, factor loading optimization
% could improve the performance by 200 bps @ 15% volatility level. 
% # [Concentration] Good signal strength only presents in the very top tier of the
% candidates. There is another 20/80 rules here, I want that thin layer of crème de la crème. Avoid dilution is more
% important than things such as using sector weight or normalize momentum
% signal. For the same reason fillts give me more securities to select,
% therefore improved the performance meaningfully. 
% # In terms of individual factors, SML & BAB is big surprise. HML behaved
% very different from the rest. MOM and QUAL is the most reliable. 

%% Most important thing 
% The biggest risk factor in transportation system is the human factor. The
% same applies for investment. Its unintuitive to give up control, human emotion will urge us to intervene exactly at point where we should not. 
% If I allow discretion, instead of abiding guidelines concluded from
% study the historical portfolio behavior by observing the data, it would
% decrease the portfolio performance by 1~2% per annual in the long run.
